### Hi! My name is Sruthika. 👋

😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers

🔭 I’m currently working on my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering (and maybe Computer Science...who knows? 🤷)

🌱 I’m currently learning elementary deep learning frameworks using Numpy. 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any introductory machine learning and/or data science projects. Specifically any that use medical datasets. ⚕️

🤔 I’m looking for help with finding and applying to any opportunities that will make the latter half of my undegraduate journey fullfilling while also allowing me to leverage my technical skills. I am particularly interested in any experiences geared towards women in tech, people of color, and/or individuals with disabilities. 

💬 Ask me about what software and hardware I like to use. 💻
