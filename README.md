### Hi! My name is Sruthika. ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering (and maybe Computer Science...who knows?)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning elementary deep learning frameworks using Numpy. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any introductory machine learning and/or data science projects. Specifically any that use medical datasets.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding and applying to any opportunities that will make the latter half of my undegraduate journey fullfilling while also allowing me to leverage my technical skills. I am particularly interested in any experiences geared towards women in tech, people of color, and/or individuals with disabilities. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what it's like to work as a teaching assistant for an introductory MATLAB course. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to email me at sbaviriseaty dot gmail dot com. Since you've already got my username, feel free to follow me on Twitter (@sbaviriseaty) and check out my website (sbaviriseaty dot me). 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an avid Jeopardy fan, indie pop aficionado, and wholesome meme enthusiast.
